A simple To-do list web app.

[This explains why it is created](http://daniellam.me/blog/getting-started-on-node-js-and-mean-stack/). You can see the web app [in action here](http://daniellam.me/examples/todolist).

Initial codes are based on [this tutorial](http://thecodebarbarian.wordpress.com/2013/07/29/introduction-to-the-mean-stack-part-two-building-and-testing-a-to-do-list/) and [its associated codes](https://github.com/vkarpov15/mean-stack-todo).
